👋 Hi, I’m Dr. James Dear (@Jdear17)
👀 I’m a researcher specializing in applying machine learning and AI to real-world challenges, including semantic segmentation of LiDAR point clouds and advanced computational modeling.
🌱 I’m currently exploring advanced techniques in computer vision, Python (PyTorch, TensorFlow), and geo-mechanical modeling for applications in mining and engineering.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI-driven projects that bridge the gap between data science and engineering, particularly in automation and optimization tasks.
